# Project: SecureApix

## Project description
SecureApix is a platform designed to control access to Custom GPTs.
It allows GPT creators to protect their GPTs by requiring user authentication (email and password) before access is granted.

The platform does NOT monetize GPTs directly.
Its purpose is to:
- Control who can access a GPT
- Manage users (clients) with login credentials
- Track login attempts (successful and failed)
- Show metrics such as active and inactive clients
- Centralize multiple GPT projects in one dashboard

SecureApix is built for creators who want to treat their GPTs as professional products, instead of sharing unrestricted public links.
